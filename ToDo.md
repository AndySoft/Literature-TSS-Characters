# The To Do List

* we need to specify how deeply we'll cover each character
	- [x] should we include spoilers? If so, which ones? Categorise a spoiler, decide which to include.
	- [x] decide wether we want to work spoilless or with spoilers. Spoilless= describing a personality and attitudes, without mentioning story.
	- [ ] look
	- [ ] what they did in the story
	- [ ] personality traits
	- [ ] relationship and family-relation map
* definitely include:
	- [ ] Mariam
	- [ ] Laila
	- [ ] Rasheed
	- [ ] Children (Aziza and Zalmai)
	- [ ] Tariq
	- [ ] Parents (Jalil, T-parents, Faria and her husband) /note: parents can be mentioned as an influential psychological force in the development of main characters, Laila and Mariam
* [ ] try to workout the contrasts between COURAGE X COWARDICE
