# The To Do List

* we need to specify how deeply we'll cover each character
	* should we include spoilers? If so, which ones? Categorise a spoiler, decide which included. 
	* decide wether we want to work spoilless or with spoilers. Spoilless= describing a personality and attitudes, without mentioning story.
	* personality traits
	* look
	* maybe what they did in the story? - spoiler
* definitely include:
	* Mariam
	* Laila
	* Rasheed
	* Children (Aziza and Zalmai)
	* Tariq
	* Parents (Jalil, T-parents, Faria and her husband) /note: parents can be mentioned as an influential psychological force in the development of main characters, Laila and Mariam
