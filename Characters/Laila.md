# Laila

### Look

In a great contrast to Mariam, Laila is a beauty. She has blonde hair, green eyes, high cheekbones and dimpled cheeks.
> *She was* a pari*, a stunner,* Mammy said*. Her beauty was the talk of the valley. It skipped two generations of women in our family, but it sure didn't bypass you, Laila*.

> Chapter 16 Page 108

Since Laila's young age, she was attractive and desired among the boys.

### Personality, character traits, background and development
Laila was growing up in the time of Soviet occupation, this era was pleasant for women, because the education was freely aviable to children no matter the gender, as long as their family supported them. Overall the basic rights and freedoms were the same for women and men. Laila's mother, Fariba, had crushed spirit, due to the preemptive death of both of her sons. Her educated and caring father, Hakim, takes on the nurture of Laila. Laila grows up to be very clever, righteous, ambitious and courageous all thanks to Hakim's open-minded nurture and Laila's natural inteligence.
