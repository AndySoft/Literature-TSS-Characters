### Personality, character, background and developement

Laila was growing up in the time of Soviet occupation, this era was pleasant for women, because the education was freely aviable to children no matter the gender, as long as their family supported them. Overall the basic rights and freedoms were the same for women and men. Laila had mother, Fariba,  that had crushed spirit, due to preemptive death of her sons and very educated, caring father, Hakim. Hakim takes on the task of nurture of Laila, because Fariba is unable to, due to her crushed spirit. Laila gows up to be very clever, rightous, ambitious and courageous due to her fatherÂ´s nurture, because he always wanted her to grow up to be strong, independant and inteligent woman.
