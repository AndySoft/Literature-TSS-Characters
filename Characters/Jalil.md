# Jalil

### Look
Jalil was very attractive, well-maintained, he had pearl white teeth and trimmed mustache, always wearing his brown suit with red tie and always smiling around Mariam. 

### Personality, character traits, background and development
Jalil is a public figure, and his affair with Nana was threatning his reputation and public appearance. He had to therefore disconnect with his daughter (Mariam), although he still loved her. Jalil is doing the best he can to visit her and to keep a healthy relationship with her, but his life is also controlled by his wifes, maybe some managers, who are keeping an eye on his actions and he cannot visit Mariam more often to convice her about his devotion. Jalil is very submissive to his wifes and his family and he is forced to give Mariam up. For that Mariam hates him for the rest of her life, which hurts Jalil and makes him regret his previous decisions.
