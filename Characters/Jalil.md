# Jalil

### Look
Jalil was very attractive, well-maintained, he had pearl white teeth and trimmed mustache, always wearing his brown suit with red tie and he seems to be always smilimng. 

### Personality, character traits, background and development
Jalil is public figure, and his affair with Nana was threatning his reputation and public appearance and against his desires he had to disconnect with his daughter. Jalil is doing the best he can to visit his daugther and to keep some healthy relationship with her, but his life is also controlled by his wifes, maybe some managers, which are keeping an eye on his actions and he cannot visit her more often and convice her about his devotion. Jalil is very submisive to his wifes and his family and he is forced to give Mariam up. For that Mariam hates him her whole life, which harms Jalil and makes him regret his previous decissions.
