# Zalmai

### Look
Zalmai bears close similarities to his father Rasheed.

### Personality, character traits, background and development
Zalmai truly worships Rasheed. He believes that his father can do no wrong, as he is too young to understand Rasheed's cruelty to the rest of the family. When Zalmai is with Laila, he behaves like a normal child, looking up to his older sister Aziza. When he is with his father, however, he notices the Rasheed's attitude towards him. Zalmai learns quickly who is dominant in the family and notices his privilege and all the advantages it brings him. When Rasheed is around, he unconscoiusly abuses the advantages and tries to imitate Rasheed's cruel behaviour. He is also very stubborn and angry when he doesn't get what he wants. Later, when Zalmai grows up a little, he shows hints of empathy towards his mother Laila, Mariam and his sister Aziza.
