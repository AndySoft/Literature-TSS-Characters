# Zalmai

### Look
Zalmai bears close similarities to his father Rasheed.

### Personality, character traits, background and development
Zalmai truly worships Rasheed. He believes that his father can do no wrong, as he is too young to understand Rasheed's cruelty to the rest of the family. When Zalmai is with Laila, he behaves like a normal child, looking up to his older sister Aziza. When he is with his father, however, he takes on his masculine air, he is very stubborn and tries to imitate Rasheed's cruel behaviour. When Rasheed dies, Zalmai is confused and sad. He doesn't accept Tariq as his father at first, and keeps asking when will Rasheed come back. At the end of the book, Zalmai finally accepts Tariq as his father.
