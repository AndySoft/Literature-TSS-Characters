### Personality, character traits, background and development
Aziza is a fast learner. She imitates the behaviour of adults, often in surprising ways, she helps Laila and Mariam take care of young Zalmai. Aziza is affected by the violence she sees in her family, she doesnt speak about it, because she knows it will not change anything. Even though Aziza notices Rasheed's different attitude towards Zalmai, she doesnt hold grudge to Zalmai and she is friendly to him and establishes friendship with him. She is mostly calm in contrast to her younger brother Zalmai, because of her friendly attitude and composure she is referred to as a "peacemaker". Aziza gives internal strength to Mariam, who finds the sense of belonging which she long longed for.
