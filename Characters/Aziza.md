### Personality, character traits, background and development
Aziza is a fast learner. She imitates the behaviour of adults, often in surprising ways. She is mostly calm in contrast to her younger brother Zalmai, and is referred to as a "peacemaker". Aziza gives internal strength to Mariam, who finds the sense of belonging which she long longed for. This eventually leads to Mariam sacrificing herself for the sake of Laila's family.
