# Mariam

### Look
Mariam is not beautiful. She has flat hair and a longish face, green eyes set closely together with wide eyebrows. The triangular shape of her face gives a hound-like impression. While her overall look is not unpleasant, there is a great contrast between her and the beauty of Laila.

### Personality, character, background and developement
Mariam was born into very poor conditions, she was living with her mother in small cottage outside of the town. She was an illegitimate child and she was viewed like one. Her father, Jalil, was rich and popular man in the town Herat, where she was born, and he had to disconnect with Nana and Mariam, because he was forced to do so, in order to keep his reputation. Nana, her mother, was left with no optimism and negative attitude towards poor Mariam. Young girl Mariam had very conflicted mind about her parents, Jalil was treating Mariam very nicely, but Nana was always portraying him in the worst possible way, as a person not worth trusting. Nana nurtured Mariam as a person of a lesser worth, as an unwanted child, thus Mariam brought her inferiority complex with her into the world. Mariam grew up to distrust Jalil and accepted the harsh lessons from Nana. Due to her background Mariam has developed very submissive personality, with no self respect and very hard working attitude.
