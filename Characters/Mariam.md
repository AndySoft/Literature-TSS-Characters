# Mariam

### Look
Mariam is not beautiful. She has flat hair and a longish face, green eyes set closely together with wide eyebrows. The triangular shape of her face gives a hound-like impression. While her overall look is not unpleasant, there is a great contrast between her and the beauty of Laila.

### Personality, character traits, background and development
Mariam was born into very poor conditions, she was living with her mother in a small cottage outside of the town. She was an illegitimate child and she is viewed as one. Her father has disconnected with Mariam and her mother, in order to keep his reputation and Nana, her mother, was left with no optimism and negative attitude towards poor Mariam. As a young girl, Mariam had a very conflicted mind about her parents, Jalil was treating Mariam very nicely, but Nana was always portraying him in the worst possible way, as a person not worth trusting. Nana nurtured Mariam as a person of a lesser worth, as an unwanted child, thus Mariam brought her inferiority complex with her into the world. Mariam grows up to distrust Jalil and accepts the harsh lessons from Nana. Due to her background Mariam develops a very submissive, quiet, shy, introvert and evasive personality and no self respect.
